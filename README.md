Positive Highlights

Consistent year-over-year growth in sales and profit.

Technology segment drives both revenue and profitability.

Customer loyalty seen in recurring top buyers.

Oceania and Asia are the strongest-performing regions.

Limitations / Challenges

U.S. market underperformance across years.

Limited data on returns, discounts, or advertising costs, which could impact margin analysis.

The dataset is static, lacking real-time updates and regional seasonality effects.

Profit dependency on a few high-margin tech subcategories — diversification is needed.
